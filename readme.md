# CubeSat Conceptual Design Generator

This program is an test suite to generate and display the data sets required for the Thesis titled, Autonomous Decision 
Making in Cubesat Conceptual Design. The aim is to investigate the creation of conceptual designs in the preliminary
design stage of a Cubesat mission, learning from past Cubesat designs and recommending off-the-shelf components to
fulfill requirements.

## Purpose

This software is designed to improve the conceptual design stage, to improve the conceptual design process and prevent
 unnecessary reinvention of the wheel.
