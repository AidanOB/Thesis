## ArtMAP

This is a python implementation of the Fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm.

### Original Author

This is based upon the MATLAB implementation written by Aaron Garrett, Jacksonville State University, Jacksonville, AL.

### Language

This is written in Python 3.4, utilising the Anaconda distribution.

### Structure

This version is currently a direct conversion from MATLAB and for testing purposes is designed to replicate the 
behaviour correctly. It does not take advantage of Python's class capabilities or the usual convention of by-rows vs 
by-cols, those are planned for future versions, if ever.
